# DuelMaster-game

#### Project under development

My attempt to create game based on Duel Masters series. Game is written with Python3 and Qt Framework.

Debug mode (you don't need any internet connection to test application) is disabled by default.
To turn it on, pass an argument "--debug=True" when launching the "main.py" file:

```python main.py --debug=True```

You also need to have installed PySide2 on your Python interpreter.
Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all required libraries in your python interpeter.

#### Todo things:
* add information about the game
* complete graveyard feature
* complete logs system
* refactor all views
* refactor tcp error system
* complete whole documentation for project
* make all effects for all cards
* check tcp connection with other player
* all minor and major changes with graphics and GUI
* creating your own avatar and cardback
* popup help messages


Card images were taken from:
